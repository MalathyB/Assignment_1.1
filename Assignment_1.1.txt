2. 3 V's of Big data: 
    
     3Vs are three defining properties or dimensions of big data.
  
     They are:
    
            ->Volume refers to the amount of data such as
        
                  *  Terabytes
        
                  *  Records
          
                  *  Transactions
        
                  *  Tables
         
                  *  Files
     
            ->Variety refers to the number of types of data includes
    
                  *  Structured
        
                  *  Unstructured
       
                  *  Semi-structured
      
                  *  All the above
     
            ->Velocity refers to the speed of data processing such as
   
                  *  Batch
        
                  *  Near-time
         
                  *  Real-time
        
                  *  Streams
     
   

3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
: 
     * Horizontal Scaling - Scale out/in
                     
                          - To add or remove nodes from a system
   
     * Vertical Scaling - Scale down/up
                
                        - To add or remove resources to a single node in a system
 
        

4. Need and Working of Hadoop
:  
      Needs:
      
          * Hadoop provides a cost effective storage solution for business
      
          * It is highly scalable storage platform
          
          * Hadoop is fault tolerance
    
      Working:
       
          * Hadoop is a data processing framework and a distributed filesystem for data storage 
       
          * It has two main systems:
        
                1.Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS)
           
                2.MapReduce engine
